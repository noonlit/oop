##2. JavaFX

Disclaimer: 95% of the code found here does not belong to me.

This is a lab project that requires implementing a JavaFX interface on top of a colleague's application.

My additions are the app.fxml file and the JavaFX.UserInterface.AppCinema class. The MainFx class is copied from the original Main and adapted to run with JavaFX.
